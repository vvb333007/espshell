Before 1.0 can be released:

0. Documentation is a bit outdated: new commands are missing, some screenshots are
   too old and do not match real command output

1. Support for $variables and wifi/ip events in command "if":
    esp32#>if $ByteCounter gt 1000 exec SomeCommand
    esp32#>if got|lost ip exec SomeCommand
    esp32#>if got|lost ip exec SomeCommand

2. Make command processor be able to expand "$" values: $1 is argv[1] and 
   $VarName is a sketch variable

3. Sequences: add sequence capture (using RMT), captured sequence display and 
   saving to a FS. (IR remote capture & playback) add sequence decode, based on
   user-supplied alphabet ("one","zero","head" and "tail")

4. Sequences: add support for byte strings (currently only bitstrings are 
   recognized)

5. Frequency meter: add support for start/stop pin (i.e. hardware, externally
   controlled start/stop). This can improve accuracy: setting GPIO high/low 
   from an PCNT interrupt handler is much faster than sending TaskNotification.

6. File manager: Implement "mv" command, make "cp" command to be able to copy 
   directory structure

7. Port a single-user, single-threaded simple FTP server - to be able to 
   upload a premade filesystem (i.e. files and directories)

8. Expose flash partitions when accessed via FTP as binary files in /flash
   bootloader.bin, nvs.bin, firmware.bin etc, (RW except the main app partition, which is RO).

9. Basic WiFi support (Ap, STA and AP+STA)
