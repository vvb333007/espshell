Roadmap:

1. Documentation is a bit outdated: new commands are missing, some screenshots are
   too old and do not match real command output.
    +a) Update main command index
    +b) Make documentation for the "nap" command
    c) Make better docs on WiFi, add static NAT mapping commands
    d) Update docs on sequences (modulation, eot, head and tail commands)
    +e) Update docs on the file system
    f) Add documentation for the "time" command
    g) Review and update "uptime" docs
    h) Review and update screenshots


2.1 Sequences: add sequence capture (using RMT), captured sequence display and 
   saving to a FS. (IR remote capture & playback) add sequence decode, based on
   user-supplied alphabet ("one","zero","head" and "tail")

2.2. Sequences: add support for byte strings (currently only bitstrings are 
   recognized)

3. Frequency meter: add support for start/stop pin (i.e. hardware, externally
   controlled start/stop). This can improve accuracy: setting GPIO high/low 
   from an PCNT interrupt handler is much faster than sending TaskNotification.

4. File manager: Implement "mv" command, make "cp" command to be able to copy 
   directory structure

5.3 Port a single-user, single-threaded simple FTP server - to be able to 
   upload a premade filesystem (i.e. files and directories)
