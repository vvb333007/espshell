Core:
-----
1. Remove Arduino Core dependency: be able to compile & work in plain ESP-IDF

Command processor:
------------------

++++1. Command aliases:
++++   Add "alias" command implements named scripts.
  
2. Make command processor be able to expand "$" values: $1 is argv[1] and $VarName is a sketch variable
    This is one of requirements for [1].

++++3. Upgrade command interpreter so it will recognize "@" symbol and supress echo until <Enter> is pressed
++++   to simulate DOS' "@echo off"

GPIO:
-----

++++1. add event system: configure GPIO masks which, if detected, trigger an alias:
++++2. add "every" command: esp32#> every INTERVAL_SEC exec TEXT


++++3. add "toggle" keyword to "pin" command, to toggle output value betwen 1 and 0  "pin 2 toggle read toggle read"
++++4. pin_save() on startup so subsequent pin_load() will be guaranteed to not load junk


PWM:
----

1. Implement phase shift between adjacent channels using .hpoint: adjacent channels share the same timer so their frequency 
   is the same, only DUTY and PHASE can be controlled

Sequence generator:
-------------------

1. add sequence capture (using RMT), captured sequence display and saving to a FS. (IR remote capture & playback)

  done: 2. make RMT's clock divisor be configurable

3. add support for byte strings (currently only bitstrings are recognized)


Pulse counter / Frequency meter:
--------------------------------

1. Add support for start/stop pin (i.e. hardware, externally controlled start/stop). This can improve accuracy: setting GPIO high/low from an PCNT interrupt handler
   is much faster than sending TaskNotification

File Manager:

1. Implement "mv" and "cp" commands to be able to copy directory structure

3. Port a single-user, single-threaded simple FTP server - to be able to upload a premade filesystem (i.e. files and directories)


UART, I2C, SPI
--------------

1. Implement "show uart|i2c|spi [NUM]" : dislpay current interface settings (pins, speed, data width, parity/stopbits where applicable)
