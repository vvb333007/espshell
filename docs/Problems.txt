Known problems not solved yet
-----------------------------
1. console_read_bytes() and console_write_bytes() for USBCDC boards 
   (like Nano ESP32, or generic ESP32-S3 devboards with USB-OTG enabled)


2. Filename completion. Even thinking of it is frustrating. BTW when 
   <TAB> is pressed - tab_pressed() is called so one wishing to help 
   can start from there

3. PWM mystery (see pwm_enable() code)


Working on
----------

Make file manager be able to mount SDMMC memory cards (either via mmc (4 and 1 bit) or spi interfaces).

Make file manager be able to send/receive files over http protocol (by deploying a minimalistic http server, uploading)
                                                                   OR
                                                     ftp  protocol (server, uploading)

Implement "mv" and "cp" commands which
  1. Work when SRC and DST are on two deifferent filesystems
  2. Both commands are able to replicate SRC directory structure by default

Make support for SPI bus and Crypto Acceleratr (use scenarios, commands). Latter
looks promising as a general use tool (encrypt/decrypt/hash arbitrary data)

Create a solution for the scenario where ESP32Cam: 
  1. makes a picture, 
  2. saves it to SIMCOM7600E internal filesystem (via uart/AT commands), and 
  3. sends by internet to remote host

  All with ESPShell commands only
