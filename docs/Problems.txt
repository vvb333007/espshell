1. console_read_bytes() and console_write_bytes() for USBCDC boards 
   (like Nano ESP32, or generic ESP32-S3 devboards with USB-OTG enabled).
   I want to do it in C, i don't want to wrap up calls to Serial.read()
   and write()


2. Filename completion on <TAB>. Even thinking of it is frustrating. 
   BTW when <TAB> is pressed - tab_pressed() is called so one wishing 
   to help can start from there

3. PWM mystery (see pwm_enable() code)
