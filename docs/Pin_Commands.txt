ESP32Shell for the Arduino Framework by vvb333007 <vvb@nym.hush.com>


ESP32 PINS (GPIOs)
------------------

ESP32 has many pins (GPIO) which can be configured to be either a
general purpose pin (GPIO) or to bear some function: be a TX pin of
a hardware UART interface or be a CLOCK line for an I2C interface
for example.

Some pins have system functions: so called "bootstrapping" pins.
Their function is to tell the bootloader what to do on boot and
how to initialize the hardware. It is ok to use them as long as 
it does not interfere with booting process

Some pins are reserved for internal use: for example pins 6-11 on
most ESP32 Dev boards are used to access internal flash: you can play
with these pins only if your program is fully in processor cache 
(be within 64kb which is impossible when using espshell)

Some pins are configured to be OUTPUT only and this can not be changed


PURPOSE
-------
In ESPShell one can play with GPIOs using "pin" command which is used
both for displaying pin information and configuring. Turning pin high
or low, sending various pulse patterns through pins, setting pin direction 
etc can be done without need to recompile user sketch

ESPShell provides commands for

  * Displaying pin information: mode (INPUT or OUTPUT), pull-up/pull-down
    configuration, digital and analog pin value and some extra information
  * Changing pin configuration, saving/restoring pin configuration
  * Setting pin HIGH or LOW (including simple HIGH/LOW sequences)


DISPLAYING PIN INFORMATION
--------------------------
To display informaton on arbitrary pin type "pin" followed by pin number.
Example below displays GPIO2 basic information:

  esp32#>pin 2
  % Digital pin value = 1
  IO[2] -
    Pullup: 0, Pulldown: 1, DriveCap: 2
    InputEn: 1, OutputEn: 1, OpenDrain: 0
    FuncSel: 2 (GPIO)
    GPIO Matrix SigOut ID: 256 (simple GPIO output)
    GPIO Matrix SigIn ID: (simple GPIO input)
    SleepSelEn: 0

The output above says that pin2 is currently HIGH, has a pulldown, has
both input and output enabled, pin drive capability is 2==medium==20mA

To get information on pin numbers and their availability one can try to
display information on non-existing pin (pin 999 as an example):

  esp32#>pin 999
  % Available pin numbers are are 0..39, except 24,28,29,30,31,
  % Invalid argument "999" ("? pin" for help)
  esp32#>

Output above tells the pin range and shows pins which simply do not 
exists in this hardware 24,28,29,30,31


SETTING PIN MODE, READING/WRITING PIN VALUES
--------------------------------------------

(No time to read? Scroll to Examples below!)

Command "pin" takes multiple argumens which are processed in order
from left to right. The first argument is a pin number and the rest
of arguments are keywords to execute. One can think of arguments as
of simple program to execute on given pin. 

For example "pin 2 save out high load" is a valid command with 4 
argument.

Here is the full list of allowed keywords:

 X       - A pin number to work with (see Example 7)
out      - Set pin to be output (i.e. pinMode(OUTPUT))
in       - Set pin to be input
up       - Set weak internal pull-up (~45 kOhm)
down     - Set weak internal pull-down
open     - Set pin "open drain" option

high     - Write logic "1" to the pin (digitalWrite(pin,HIGH)). Also sets OUTPUT
           flag for the pin.
low      - Write logic "0" to the pin. Also sets OUTPUT flag for the pin.
seq X    - Send sequence number X over the pin. See documentation file
          "docs/Pulse_Generator" on sequences and how to use them
pwm X Y  - Enable frequency generator on fiven pin. X is the frequency in Hertz
          and Y is the duty. Both parameters are mandatory. Setting frequency to 0
          disables frequency generator. Y (duty) is a floating point number in
          range (0..1)

read    - Digital read
aread   - Analog read*

delay X - Make a delay of X milliseconds before executing next
          keyword. (see Example 5. below)

save    - Save pin configuration. Each save rewrites previous save
load    - Load pin configuration. reads previously saved data. reading does not
          erase saved data.


hold    - "freeze" pin state and output value. Frozen pin remains frozen after
          reboot (as long as power to the chip is provided. rebooting via 
          POWERUP unfreezes pin) See NOTE1 at the end of this document.
release - "unfreeze" pin which was "frozen" by "pin X hold" See NOTE1 at the 
          end of this document

loop X  - repeat whole command X times. The "loop X" keyword must be the last
          argument of the command. Pressing anykey in your terminal software
          or sending any character from Arduino IDE Serial Monitor interrupts
          loop

Multiple keywords can be used in single "pin" command (separated by spaces):
"pin 2 out open up" is a valid command, executing 3 keywords in sequence.
Just like that you can think of "pin" command like it is a "sequence of commands
for the pin". 


Lets go through some simple examples which show the use of "pin" command: 
it is much easier to learn from examples that just reading countless tables 
and descriptions.


Example 1. Dsiplay GPIO4 information:
-------------------------------------

   esp32#>pin 4


Example 2. Set pin 33 to OUTPUT and INPUT, PULL_UP, OPEN_DRAIN and HIGH:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   esp32#>pin 33 out in up open high


Example 3. Save pin state, configure it to OUTPUT, HIGH, then restore pin state:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   esp32#>pin 33 save out high
   esp32#>pin 33 load

   NOTE: setting pin "low" or "high" implies pin is OUTPUT, so internally
   "high" actually expanded to "out high", and above command can be written
   as
 
   esp32#>pin 33 save high
   esp32#>pin 33 load


Example 4. Read analog value from pin 33:
-----------------------------------------
   esp32#>pin 33 aread

   NOTE: analog read command ("aread") is implemented via analogRead() call which
   writes new configuration to the pin in the process of reading. In other words, 
   after "pin 18 aread" command is executed  pin 18 gets reconfigured (does not
   respond to digitalRead() afterwards). Use "save" and "load" keywords to 
   preserve pin state:

   esp32#>pin 33 read save aread load

   Arguments are processed left to right: the command above perform a digitalRead()
   on the pin, then saves its state, performs analogRead and restores pin state.


Example 5, Save pin state, configure it for OUTPUT, set pin HIGH for 250 
           milliseconds then set it LOW for 100ms, then HIGH again for 50ms and 
           finally restore the pin configuration:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  esp32#>pin 33 save high delay 250 low delay 100 high delay 50 load
  
  NOTE: although you can create simple signal patters with "delay" it is normally 
        used for something simple, like relay control. Complex signal sequences 
        could be configured with use of Pulse Generator see documentation files
        "docs/Pulse_Generator.txt" and "docs/Tone_Generator_And_Counter.txt"

  NOTE: Command "pin" can be interrupted during long (>5seconds) delays
        by pressing any key in your terminal or sending any character in your
        Arduino IDE Serial Monitor. Delays shorter than that are not interruptible
        so one have to wait until delay is finished


Example 7: Set pin 2 high, pin 3 low, wait for 1 second and invert pin values
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  esp32#>pin 2 high 3 low delay 1000 2 low 3 high


Example 8: Blink LED on GPIO2 with 500ms delay, for 20 times
------------------------------------------------------------

  esp32#>pin 2 high delay 500 low delay 500 loop 20

  NOTE: whenever "loop" keyword is used the "pin" commands become interruptible:
        by pressing any key in your terminal or sending any character in your
        Arduino IDE Serial Monitor you can abort the current command.


Example 9: blink a led on GPIO2 with of its 30% brightness 
----------------------------------------------------------


  Here we need to adjust brightness so we need to use PWM (set the frequency 
  to 5kHz and duty cycle to 30%):

  esp32#>pin 2 pwm 5000 0.3 delay 500 pwm 0 0 delay 500 loop 999

  NOTE



Some more examples:

pin 12 in up                - are equivalent of pinMode(12, INPUT_PULLUP)
pin 12 read save aread load - read digital and analog values of a pin
pin 12 hold                 - make pin to freeze its configuration & output value
pin 12 release              - unfreeze pin


(*)
Keyword "hold" makes pin to hold its state & output level until it 
release either by POWERDOWN or "pin release" command. When pin is frozen all 
attempts to write or configure it will be ignored by hardware. However when 
pin is released then it rereads last configuration issued:

Lets say we freeze pin 2 and then write 1 to it: since pin is frozen, it will
not change it walue from 0 to 1. However when we release the pin it immediately
becomes "logic 1" as if writing of an "1" was queued
