ESP32Shell for the Arduino Framework by vvb333007 <vvb@nym.hush.com>

Squarewave generation and pulse counting
----------------------------------------


ESPShell includes ability to generate a squarewave signal on any pin with
user configurable frequency and duty cycle. Frequency can be set from 1Hz
up to 78.277kHz with duty cycle ranging from 0 (=0%) to 1 (=100%). Default
value for the duty cycle is 0.5 which means 50% duty cycle. LEDC driver is
used for this squarewave generator.

SQUAREWAVE GENERATOR
--------------------

Command "pwm" starts squarewave output on given pin:

esp32#>pwm 2 1

The command above starts a 1Hz squarewave on pin 2 (duty cycle is 50%)


The duty cycle parameter can be set as third parameter to the "pwm" 
command: set frequency on pin 2 to 5Hz, duty cycle around 10%:

esp32#>pwm 2 5 0.1

To stop squarewave generator on given pin use "pwm" command with just one 
parameter. Example below shows how to stop squarewave generation on pin 2


esp32#>pwm 2

NOTE: some boards refuse to execute "pwm" commands soon after startup. The
workaround is to execute the same command again :). working on it.


PULSE COUNTER
-------------

Command "count" is used to count pulses in given pin. It takes up to 3 
parameters: pin to count pulses on, which pulse edge to count (positive,
negative or both) and a time interval during which pulses are counted.
Command can be used with just one parameter - pin on which measurement are
made. In that case time interval defaults to 1000 milliseconds and counter
looks for positive pulse edges

Command syntax is: "count PIN [TIME_MS [pos|neg|both]]" where PIN is a pin number, 
"pos", "neg" and "both" are pulse edge types which we want to count and TIME_MS
is the time during which measurements are made (default is 1000 ms). Last two
parameters can be omitted. Their default values are "pos" and "1000".

Pulse counting can be interrupted at any moment by pressing any key in termianl
software or sending a character in Arduino IDE Serial Monitor.

Lets connect pin2 and pin4 with a jumper. Start a squarewave generator on pin2 
and count pulses on pin4:

esp32#>pwm 2 10
esp32#>count 4
% Counting pulses on GPIO4.. 10 pulses (1.000 sec)

NOTE: Use "pin X save" and "pin X load" to save/restore pin state. Configuring
pin as a squarewave generator rewrites pin settings so previous settings can be
lost. On "pin save" and "pin load" please refer to Pin_Commands.txt
