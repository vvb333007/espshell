COMMANDS AFFECTING ESPSHELL INTERFACE
</h2>
</p>
<p>
Note: commands below do not show up on command lists (lists displayed by "?" 
or "help") commands: these are rarely used but their misuse may require you
to reboot
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<b>history</b>&nbsp;[on|off]
</td><td>
<p>
  Enable / Disable command history. By default it is enabled and available on
  pressing <UP> and <DOWN> arrows (does not work in Arduino Serial Monitor).
  Command without arguments displays current state: "history on" or "history off"
  <br><br>
  Default value is "history on"
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>colors</b>&nbsp;[on|off|auto]</td><td>
<p>
  Enable or disable ANSI terminal colors. If you are using a terminal software 
  like PuTTY or TeraTerm then this option is better to be "on". For simple 
  terminals like Arduino Serial Monitor it must be "off" or your screen will be 
  flooded with strange messages like this:   1;36]m ]]J 7]m  and so on
</p><p>
  Default value is "colors auto". In this mode ESPShell tries to guess user 
  terminal type and switch colors on or off depending on that. Guessing works
  by looking into what comes from the user: any keystrokes with lower keycodes
  (never sent by Arduino Serial Monitor) trigger color mode ON.
</p><p>
  Disable colors with "colors off" if your terminal does not support colors, but 
  ESPShell thinks it does.
</p><p>
  Executing this command without any arguments displays current state of colorer
</p><p>
<pre>
    esp32#>colors
    % Color is "auto"
    esp32#>
</pre>
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>echo</b>&nbsp;[off|on|silent]</td><td>
<p>
  Some applications of espshell may require processing of shell output and issuing
  shell commands in automated mode; one of such examples is one esp32 controlling
  another esp32-cam via UART link by executing shell commands on the espcam.
</p><p>
  By default everything that user types is echoed back by ESPShell and this 
  behavior can be controlled with the "echo" command;
</p><p>
<pre>  
           "off" : Disables ESPShell from printing out its prompt and disables user
           input echo. Input is processed but just not displayed; 

           Equivalent of common "ATE0" command for modems. When echo is disabled user
           still can use line editing/history scrolling but it is just not displayed.


           This mode is useful for automated processing when ESPShell output is 
           going to be processed by software: we don't want to see and process our
           own input


            "on"  : Default is to echo user input & display espshell prompt.
            Equivalent of "ATE1" modem command


            "silent" : Completely disable ALL espshell output to the terminal.
 
                * No error messages will be displayed.
                * User input is not echoed back
                * Input is processed, commands are executed and the only difference
                  is that commands do not print anything.

            This mode is used when we don't want espshell to interfere with sketch's
            output. Sketch has full access to the Serial, while ESPShell doesn't print
            anything to it;
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>tty</b>&nbsp;NUMBER</td>
<td><p>
  Change ESPShell's input stream to uart UART.
</p><p>
  Default input source is UART0 (or USB-CDC) but it can be changed with "tty" command:
  this is used in some automation scenarios when one needs to give control over the shell
  to another user (connected to uart1 may be). With this command you can "give" but you
  can't "take" : to get control back one must execute "tty 0" on uart1
</p><p>
  The UART user switches to must be initialized otherwhise this command fails.
</p>
<p>UART - is the new UART number (0..3) or number 99 to switch to USB-CDC interface</p>
