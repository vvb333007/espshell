<p>
ESPShell includes ability to generate a squarewave signal on any pin with
user configurable frequency and duty cycle. Frequency can be set from 1Hz
up to 10 MHz with duty cycle ranging from 0 (=0%) to 1 (=100%). Default
value for the duty cycle is 0.5 which means 50% duty cycle. LEDC driver is
used for this squarewave generator.
</p>
<p>
Minimum and maximum frequencies which can be achieved with ESP32's PWM
depend on many factors and can not be precisely stated here. ESP32 can
go down to 1 Hz, while ESP32S3 low limit is higher. 
</p>
<p>
Although ESP32S3 chip has 8 PWM channels but only 4 timers so it is 4
different frequences can be generated at the same time through 4 different 
pins. It is little better with basic ESP32 which has 16 channels thus
allowing for 8 frequencies. 
</p>
<p>
There are 4 commands that are used to start/stop PWM generation, change
some settings and displaying information:
</p>
<p>
 <ul>
  <li><b>pwm</b> <i>PIN FREQ</i> [ <i>DUTY</i> [ <i>CHANNEL</i> ] ]"</li>
  <li><b>show pwm</b></li>

  <li><b>var ledc_res</b> [<i>NUMBER</i>]</li>
  <li><b>var pwm_ch_inc</b>  [<i>NUMBER</i>]</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Command "pwm" starts a squarewave output on given pin:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  esp32#>pwm 2 1000
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The command above starts a 1 kHz squarewave on pin 2 (duty cycle is 50%)
It is not blocking command, so it is not necessary to use "<B>&</B>" option
to the command (see <a href="Basics.html#background">background execution</a>): it executes in a background by 
default.
</p>
<p>
The duty cycle parameter can be set as third argument to the "pwm" 
command: lets set frequency on pin 2 to 5000Hz, duty cycle around 30%:
</p>
<p><pre>
  esp32#>pwm 2 5000 0.3
</pre></p>
<p>
To stop a squarewave generator on given pin use "pwm" command with just one 
parameter. Example below shows how to stop squarewave generation on pin 2
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  esp32#>pwm 2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Setting frequency to 0 Hz or using a keyword "off" in place of frequency
will have the same effect: disabling PWM on pin. Three commands below are equivalent:
</p>

<p><pre>
  esp32#>pwm 2
  esp32#>pwm 2 0
  esp32#>pwm 2 off
</pre></p>

<p id=duty><h2><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>PWM DUTY CYCLE AND ITS RESOLUTION</h2></p>

<p>
One important thing to consider is the <i>duty cycle resolution</i>. Although
ESPShell expects a floating point number as a duty cycle (e.g. 0.721), the
hardware has its limits: the higher the PWM frequency is the less precise 
we can set a duty cycle. For example, 1000 Hz frequency generator has
14 bit precision for its duty cycle. That means, the duty cycle can be anything
from zero to 2^14-1. With frequency of 10MHz we have only 3 bits to represent
our duty cycle..
</p>

<p>
ESPShell selects best available duty cycle precision (resolution) for
given frequency. This default behaviour however, can be overriden with 
"var ledc_res" command: being set to a positive value it overrides calculated 
duty resolution.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  esp32#>var ledc_res 8
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  The command above sets PWM duty cycle resolution to 8 bits. Attempt to start
  10Mhz PWM will fail in this case
</p>

<p id=channels><h2><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>PWM CHANNELS</h2></p>

<p>
ESP32 has 16 (while ESP32S3 has 8) so-called LEDC (PWM) channels. Adjacent 
channels (i.e. channel0 and channel1  or channel6 and channel7) share same timer 
thus not able to generate 2 different frequencies: instead, changing channel 
frequency immediately changes frequency on its adjacent channel.
</p>

<p>
Because of this, ESPShell selects only **even** channel numbers for its operation.
Doing so guarantees that every other PWM output has its unique frequency; however it
reduces the number of available channels: instead of 8 only 4 are available on ESP32S3.
</p>

<p>
For many PWM applications involving many PWM outputs, the frequency is usually the same, while 
duty cycle can vary: one of such example is a multiple led strips. Multiple-output regulated
power inverter is the another example.
</p>

<p>
In such cases ESPShell can be set to use both odd and even numbers so all available channels
can be used (up to 16 on original ESP32): this is done by executing "var pwm_ch_inc 1" shell command.
</p>

<p>
Additionally one can manually set hardware channel number to use.
In most cases we don't need to specify this channel number: it is autoselected by cycling
through numbers 0, 2, 4, ...; Shell uses simple formula to select channels to use:
</p>

<p><pre>
        Channel_To_Use_Next_Time = Current_Channel + "var pwm_ch_inc"
</pre></p>

<p>
Below is the command to enable 1kHz 50% duty PWM on pin1, using hardware channel 2:
<pre>
  esp32#>pwm 1 1000 0.5 2     < --- 4th argument is a channel number
</pre>

Doing so results in altering internal espshell channel counter:

<pre>
  esp32#>pwm 2 1000 0.5 5
  % PWM on pin#2, 1000 Hz (0.5% duty cycle, channel#5) is enabled
  % PWM channel 7 is to be used next, if not explicitly set
</pre>

Channel #7 was selected because of <b>pwm_ch_inc</b> default value which is 2. Lets look
at example below to see how changing this variable affects channel selection behaviour:

<pre>
  esp32#>pwm 2 1000 0.5 5
  % PWM on pin#2, 1000 Hz (0.5% duty cycle, channel#5) is enabled
  % PWM channel 7 is to be used next, if not explicitly set         < -- channel 7

  esp32#>var pwm_ch_inc 1

  esp32#>pwm 2 1000 0.5 5
  % PWM on pin#2, 1000 Hz (0.5% duty cycle, channel#5) is enabled
  % PWM channel 6 is to be used next, if not explicitly set        < -- channel 6
</pre>

Setting "pwm_ch_inc "to 0 will prevent channel number from changing (unless /channel/
argument is used)
</p>

<p id=show><h2><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>DISPLAYING PWM INFORMATION</h2></p>

<p>
To display status & parameters of PWM signals there is a dedicated "show" command:
</p>
<p>

<table>  <tr><td><b>show pwm</b></td><td>Displays current state of all PWM sources</td></tr></table>


  Example output looks similar to the one below
</p>
<p align=center>
<img src="i/show_pwm.jpg" width="70%" height="70%" alt="Typical view" /><br>
<i>Fig. 2: Example output of &quot;<b>show pwm</b>&quot; command</i>
</p>

<p>

  Table above says that pin#2 is active PWM source, 10MHz, 57% duty cycle; Although it
  was set to 50% by command "pwm 2 10000000 0.5", limitations of the hardware only allow
  3 bits as the duty value, so it can be set only approximately; Pin 18 is a PWM source too, with frequency of 1KHz and duty cycle of 75%.
</p>
<p>  
  DutyAbs is the <i>absolute</i> duty cycle value, which depends on duty % and duty resolution 
  parameters; Other columns carry pin numbers, frequencies and a hardware channel number
  used.
