<p><h2 id=wit><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>WHAT IS THIS:</h2></p>

<p>
 This is a debugging/development tool (<b>a library for Arduino framework</b>) for use 
 with Arduino projects on ESP32 hardware. 
</p>
<p>
 Provides a command line interface (CLI) on serial port running in parallel to your 
 Arduino sketch. It is not standalone program - this tool attaches to the user sketch 
 (at compile time) and enchances any sketch (even an empty one) with a shell.
</p><p>
 User can enter and execute commands (there are many built-in commands) in a way 
 similar to Linux shell while their sketch is running. There are commands to control
 sketch execution (to some extent) : commands to suspend or resume sketch execution.
 One can simply press Ctrl+C to suspend sketch while shell will continue to work. 
</p><p>
 User interacts with ESPShell either through Arduino IDE Serial Monitor or through any other communication 
 software like PuTTY, TeraTerm, Linux "cu" utility and many others. Developer of this 
 library uses TeraTerm on Windows 10. Default settings for both Arduino IDE Serial 
 Monitor and TeraTerm are shown on screenshots: <a href="TeraTerm_Default_Settings.jpg">for TeraTerm</a>
 and for <a href="Arduino_IDE_Serial_Monitor_Default_Settings.jpg">Arduino IDE Serial Monitor</a>. ESPShell
 echoes user input so "local echo" must be disabled (see screenshots above)
</p>
<p>
 This library can be useful for developers who are interfacing new I<sup>2</sup>C or UART devices
 as espshell has commands to create/delete hardware interfaces, send/receive
 data. Interfacing GPS (uart-based) chips or GSM modems, making libraries for
 I<sup>2</sup>C devices. 
</p>
 <p>
 Developers, who do home automation: shell has commands to do whatever one wants with 
 GPIO (check out <a href="GPIO.html">GPIO commands</a>), so interfacing relays now don't even require 
 you to write any code. There are PWM generator and a frequency meter, a pulse counter 
 and a pulse pattern generator are available on any GPIO.
</p>
<p align=center><img src="i/espshell.jpg" alt="ESPShell main screen" width="70%" height="70%"><br><i>Fig. 1: ESPShell, how does it looks like</i></p>
<p>
<h2><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>WHAT IS THE POINT?</h2>
</p>
<p>
The main idea behind this library is to be able to make changes without recompiling/reuploading your sketch every time
 when all you want is to make small changes or perform an experiment. That means much less "change / recompile / upload / run / see the result" cycles.
</p>
<p>
Another point is to have execution control over the sketch and be able to examine sketch variables; 
</p>
<p>
Sketch uses wrong pin number to access external device? That can be changed from ESPShell.<br> 
Do we need to change UART/I<sup>2</sup>C/etc interface speed? Can be done by shell commands.<br>
</p>
<p>
I<sup>2</sup>C bus scan, pause sketch execution, talk directly to GPS or GSM modem connected to uart interface, talk directly to I<sup>2</sup>C devices, like RTC or EEPROM, change / display sketch variables and many more
can be done by entering shell commands.
</p>

<p> 
<h2 id=add><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>HOW TO ADD IT TO YOUR ARDUINO PROJECT/SKETCH:</h2>
</p>
<p>
This library is available via the <b>Arduino Library Manager</b>:
</p>
<p>
<a href="i/library_manager.jpg">
1. Open the <b>Library Manager</b><br />
2. Search for <b>espshell</b><br />
3. Choose the latest version and click <b>Install</b><br />
</a>
</p>

<p>To install manually (e.g., the latest source code from GitHub):
</p>
<p>
1. Create the folder: `/YourSketchBook/libraries/espshell`  <br />
2. Copy the library contents (`/docs`, `/src`, `/examples`, etc.) into that folder  <br />
3. Restart the Arduino IDE<br />
</p>
<p>
 This library does not require you to call any functions to start the shell, except one line of 
 code: add <br>
<pre>
#include "espshell.h"
</pre>
somewhere at the beginning of your sketch and thats it.
</p><p>
 Compile and upload your sketch as usual. ESPShell starts automatically when your sketch 
 starts, by intercepting execution control and starting its own task. Shell intercepts control at the very beginning, before
  Arduino's <span class=func>setup()</span> and <span class=func>loop()</span>, before ESP-IDF's <span class=func>app_main()</span>
</p><p>
When ESPShell starts it displays a welcome banner and is ready to accept commands:
</p>
<p align=center>
<img src="i/welcome_banner.jpg" alt="ESPShell Welcome Banner" width="70%" height="70%" />
<br>
<i>Fig. 1: Welcome Banner</i>
</p>
<p>
 <b>Note:</b> ESPShell waits for Serial to become initialized; if Serial is not initialized by user
 sketch (i.e. <span class=func>Serial.begin( ... )</span> was never called) then ESPShell will be inactive, sleeping, 
 waiting for the Serial to start (i.e. waits for sketch to call <span class=func>Serial.begin( ... )</span> ). If ESPShell was <a href="Customizing.html">set up to use some other UART</a> (e.g. UART1) then 
  ESPShell will wait for <span class=func>Serial1.begin( ... )</span>.
</p><p>
<h2 id=ui><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>User Interface</h2>
</p>
<p>
ESPShell provides a command line interface (CLI), with command line editing capabilities, commands history and syntax coloring;
</p>
<p>
ESPShell works fine in Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor, however connecting to the shell through
 terminal software is preferred. Author uses TeraTerm on Windows but any other software will 
 do the job. Arduino Serial Monitor is not a terminal program and that fact prevents 
  some features of ESPShell to be used: syntax coloring, hotkeys, UART bridge and others.
</p>

<p>
User interacts with the shell through the Serial interface (UART or USB-CDC) by entering commands and/or pressing hotkeys; ESPShell displays its prompt (e.g. "<b>esp32#&gt;</b>"),
 reads and executes commands entered by user - in a way similar to Linux shell: parses user input, performs requested actions, displays errors if there 
  were any and the cycle repeats.
</p>

<p align=center>

</p>

<p><h3 id=keyboard><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>Keyboard use & key bindings</h3></p>

<p>
  These keys are recognized by ESPShell:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  Key             | Meaning / Action performed
  ----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
  [ENTER]         | Execute commands, interrupt running commands
                  |
  [ARROWS]        | Arrows: move cursor &larr; or &rarr;. Up &uarr; and &darr; down arrows scroll 
                  | through the command history.
                  |
  [DEL]           | As in Notepad
                  |
  [BACKSPACE]     | As in Notepad
                  |
 [HOME] and [END] | These two do not work. Instead use Ctrl+A as &lt;HOME&gt; and Ctrl+E
                  | as &lt;END&gt;.
                  |
   [TAB]          | Quick jump from one word in the line to another. Fast switching
                  | between command arguments: continously press to cycle through
                  | all arguments/words in the command line
                  |
  Ctrl+R          | History search. Press Ctrl+R and start typing. Press &lt;ENTER&gt; 
                  | to search for command executed before
                  |
  Ctrl+K          | Clear the line from cursor to the end
                  |
  Ctrl+L          | Clear the screen, keep user input, enable colors and show a hint
                  |
  Ctrl+Z          | Same as entering "exit" and pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; : moves up one level
                  | in command hierarchy: there are main commands and commands that 
                  | are arranged as subdirectories. Ctrl+Z is used to exit such subdirectories.
                  |
  Ctrl+C          | Suspend sketch execution. Resume with "resume" command.
                  |
  [ESC] 56 [ESC]  | Entering an arbitrary ASCII character: Press &lt;ESC&gt;, then enter 1, 2 or 3 digit 
                  | decimal ASCII code and pressing &lt;ESC&gt; again.
                  | Example: Send a break (Ctrl+C, ascii code 3) : &lt;ESC&gt;3&lt;ESC&gt;
                  |
[ESC] [BACKSPACE] | While &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; simply erases 1 character, pressing &lt;ESC&gt; and then &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;
                  | will erase 1 word

</pre>
</p><p>
 Please note that help page on key combinations can be obtained by executing 
 shell command "? keys":
</p>
<p align=center>
<img src="i/keys.jpg" width="70%" height="70%" /><br>
<i>Fig. 3: Built-in help page <b>? keys</b></i>
</p>
<p>
 By entering "? keys" command one can find key combinations which can be 
 used on "dumb" terminals: if (for example) arrows keys in your terminal
 are not working correctly then you can use Ctrl+F and Ctrl+B as an alternative:
 Ctrl+F moves cursor [F]orward (&rarr;), Ctrl+B moves it backwards (&larr;)
</p><p>
 Keys should be more or less intuitive for Linux shell users.
</p>
<p>
  <i>NOTE: Simple terminal programs like Arduino Serial Monitor can not send Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Z keycodes
  which are essential in GSM/LTE modems.</i>
</p>

<p>
<h2 id=short><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>Autocompletion vs Incompletion</h2>
</p><p>
 ESPShell won't autocomplete commands for you on pressing [TAB]: instead ESPShell
 simply accepts non-completed input, i.e. commands and command arguments can be 
 <i>shortened</i>. Lets look at the difference:
</p><p>
 In Linux shell (say, <i>bash</i>) one types "<b>upt</b>" and presses &lt;TAB&gt; to let the shell autocomplete
 the command to "<b>uptime</b>". 
</p><p>
 In contrast in ESPShell one can simply type "<b>upt</b>" (or even "<b>up</b>") and press 
 &lt;Enter&gt;. ESPShell does not require anyone to type command "sequence": "seq" 
 is more than enough.
</p><p>
 Commands such as (for example) &quot;<b><a href="GPIO.html">pin 19 out high delay 500 low delay 100</a></b>&quot;
 can be written as &quot;<b>p 19 o h d 500 l d 500</b>&quot; and it will be understood by the shell.
</p>
<p>
ESPShell does its best to distinguish between shortened commands to avoid unintended command execution: commands "<b>uptime</b>" and "<b>uart 1</b>"
 can be both shortened to "<b>u</b>". Simply because "<b>uptime</b>" command has no arguments while "<b>uart</b>" always have an argument the shell is able to understand that 
"<b>u 1</b>" is "<b>uart 1</b>", not "<b>uptime</b>".
 However it is not always the case so do not overshorten: "sh c" can be either "show counters" or "show cpuid" and in this case ESPShell picks up first command in the list, in this case it will be "show counters". ( Command list can be obtained by entering command "?" or "help" )
</p>
<p>
<h2 id=help><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>Built-in help system</h2>
</p>

<p>
ESPShell tries to be informative and has built-in help system which can do a few
things - provide manual pages for commands and provide details & possible solutions 
when errors and failures occurs: e.g. an attempt to use non-existent pin will most likely
result in a message about pin numbers available on given board.
</p>

<p>
<h3 id=huse><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>A question mark</h3></p><p>
Help system is available via "<b>?</b>" command/hotkey: as a command it displays manual pages for commands,
displays the list of available commands. As a hotkey it displays help for the command user currently entering.
<p>
Listing of all available commands is done by typing "?" and pressing &lt;Enter&gt;:
</p>

<p align=center>
<img src="i/qm_list.jpg" width="70%" height="70%" alt="Example command list page"/><br>
<i>Fig. 4: Available commands</i>
</p>
<p>
  Please note that <b>iic, uart, sequence, files, camera</b> are <a href="#dirs"><i>command directories</i></a> each with its own set of commands.<br>
  User can read help pages for commands by entering a question mark "?" followed by keywords: either <a href="#short">shortened</a> or full.

E.g. to read manual page on command "<b>sequence</b>" one can enter "<b>? seq</b>" and press &lt;ENTER&gt;; other examples are "? pin",
  "? count" and so on: a question mark and command name will display help pages
  for commands</p><p>
Below is the example of "<b>? count</b>" execution:
</p>

<p align=center>
<img src="i/qm_count.jpg" width="70%" height="70%" alt="Example help page"/><br>
<i>Fig. 5: Built-in help page for command <b>count</b></i>
</p>

<p>
  If, however, you would like to read help pages <b>during command entering</b> (e.g. you 
  don't remember what next argument should be) then just press "?" and help page will appear above your input 
  You can try to type "cou" and press "?" to see "count" command help page.
</p>

<p>
  The "?" is a hotkey and this behaviour might be annoying in cases when you need
  to enter actual symbol "?" and not invoke help system instead. For example, you
  are writing "Hello World?" string into some file: pressing "?" will invoke help
  page and this is not what we want. Well, one of the solutions is to disable "?" hotkey processing by executing
<pre>
  esp32#>var bypass_qm 1
</pre>
command. (<i>Command <b>var</b> here sets internal shell variable "bypass_qm" to 1</i>). Help subsystem still will be available but instead of "<b>?</b>" one have to type "<b>help</b>"
</p>

<p>
<h3 id=hsyntax><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>Help page syntax</h3>
</p><p>
  When typical help page is displayed, one may notice that special symbols (along with
  colors, on color terminals) are used to describe <i>command syntax</i>. Command syntax can be found at the very
  beginning of any help page. Lets look at help page for command "count": (see <a href="qm_count.jpg"><i>Fig. 5</i></a>, or type "? count" and press &lt;ENTER&gt;)
</p>
<p>
    <pre>
    esp32#>? count
    % -- Pulse counter --
    % "count PIN [NUMBER | trigger | filter LENGTH]*"
    %
    % Count pulses on pin PIN for NUMBER milliseconds (default value is 1 second)
    % Optional "trigger" keyword suspends the counter until the first pulse
    % Optional "filter LEN" keyword ignores pulses shorter than LEN nanoseconds
    ...
    ...
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  This is the very first lines of a help page "? count". Here we can see those <i>special symbols</i>: square brackets "[" and "]", a vertical bar "|", an 
  asterisk "*" and some words typed in UPPERCASE.
</p><p>
<table>
<tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td><p align=center>UPPERCASE</p></td><td><p>A number or some text string. Any user input. Example help page above
says that command "count" has 3 such parameters: pin number, measurement time and length.
In  majority of commands an UPPERCASE argument is a number, however some commands
also may expect text
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align=center>lowercase</p></td><td><p>These are keywords: command name itself, words "trigger" and "filter"; On help pages these are usually yellow (command name is white)</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align=center>[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</p></td><td><p>Square brackets are used to denote OPTIONAL parameters. On color terminals these are
displayed in dark yellow color. 
Example above has only 1 mandatory parameter (pin number) while
rest are optional and can be omitted
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align=center>|</p></td><td><p>Verical bar: this is simply logic "OR" operation. In sence "this OR that". Example
above says that we can enter a NUMBER <b>or</b> the "trigger" keyword <b>or</b> the "filter" keyword
plus LENGTH parameter
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align=center>*</p></td><td><p>Located next to closing bracket (i.e. "<b>)*</b>" or "<b>]*</b>") indicates, that anything within the brackets can appear
              multiple times.</p></td></tr>              

</table>
<p>
Other symbols that are also used in help pages (but not in example above) are <i>range symbol</i> (double dot, "<b>..</b>" ) and <i>mandatory symbol</i> ( rounded brackets, "<b>()</b>"):
</p>
<p>
<table>
  <tr><td>1<b>..</b>10</td><td>A number in range from 1 to 10 inclusive</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>(</b>arg1|arg2|...|argN<b>)*</b></td><td>Mandatory argument: any combination of arg1 and arg2 but not empty one (at least one argument must be specified)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><b>[</b>arg1|arg2|...|argN<b>]*</b></td><td>Optional argument: any combinations of arg1 and arg2 including empty argument</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
<h2 id=background><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>BACKGROUND VS FOREGROUND EXECUTION</h2>
</p><p>
 By default all ESPShell commands are blocking (well, most of them, not all). That
 means that the <b>shell will wait for command to finish</b> before starting to accept new 
 input: commands executed in sequence, one by one. 
</p><p>
This behaviour could be changed by using an &amp; symbol:
</p><p>
 Adding &quot;&amp;&quot; as <b>very last argument</b> to any command instructs ESPShell to execute this particular 
 command as separate task, in parallel to other processes. This behaviour
 is well known to Linux users, where <b>&amp;</b> is used to run commands in background.
</p><p>
 This option (background execution) is especially useful with commands "pin" and 
 "count" which may take long time to finish. Every running background command 
 allocates around 5000 bytes of stack memory which is freed after execution
</p><p>
 Any background command can be stopped by using command <a href="Kill_Suspend_And_Resume.html">kill</a></p>

<p>
<h2 id=cmds><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>ESPSHELL BUILT-IN COMMANDS</h2>
</p><p>

  <h3 id=dirs><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>Command directories</h3>
</p><p>
  ESPShell commands are grouped into <i>command directories</i>: commands related to UART are in "uart" directory, commands dealing with files are in "files" directory and so on.
  Main command directory is what you see when espshell starts. Main command directory contains commands AND other command directories; you can think of command directories as of real filesystem directories filled with executable files
</p><p>
  If one wants to execute UART-related commands he/she must <b>enter</b> the corresponding
  command directory:
</p><p>
<pre>
    Example: entering UART configuration mode

      esp32#>uart 0 
      esp32-uart0>
</pre>
</p><p>
 Executing command "<b>uart 0</b>" switches current command directory to UART0 
 command directory;  pressing then "<b>Ctrl+Z</b>" or executing "<b>exit</b>" command changes command
 directory back to the Main.
</p><p>
 When inside of any command directory, commands from the outside are available and can be 
 executed even if they don't show up on command list:
</p><p><pre>
  Example: 

      <b>&rarr;Entering UART0 command directory:</b>

      esp32#>uart 0
      % You are about to configure the Serial espshell is running on. Be careful
      % Entering UART configuration mode. Ctrl+Z or "exit" to return
      % Hint: Main commands are still avaiable (but not visible in "?" command list)


      <b>&rarr;List all available commands:</b>

      esp32-uart0>?
      % Enter "? command" to get details about specific command.
      % Enter "? keys" to display the espshell keyboard help page
      %
      % "?"          : Commands list & help
      % "up"         : Initialize uart (pins/speed)
      % "baud"       : Set baudrate
      % "down"       : Shutdown
      % "read"       : Read data from UART
      % "tap"        : Talk to device connected
      % "write"      : Send bytes over this UART
      % "exit"       : Exit

      <b>&rarr;Execute command, which is not on the list but exists in main commands list:</b>

      esp32-uart0>uptime
      % Last boot was 17 seconds ago
      % Restart reason was "Board power-on"
      esp32-uart0>
</pre>
In example above shell searches Main command directory after it realizes that there is no command "uptime" in uart0 directory, 
</p><p>
To exit command directory command "<b>exit</b>" is used.
Note: Ctrl+Z is a hotkey for command "exit"
</p><p>
Other command directories ESPShell has are: <a href="UART.html">uart</a>, <a href="I2C.html">i<sup>2</sup>c</a>, <a href="Filesystems.html">files</a>, <a href="Pulse_Generator.html">sequence</a> and <a href="Camera.html">camera settings</a>

             Without arguments: puts CPU into sleep until any UART activity:  
             CPU wakes up by UART (press any key to wake up). Wake up condition is 3 
             positive edges. It is recommended to use &lt;Enter&gt; as an abort key
<pre>         
             Example:   
                 esp32#>nap
                 % Entering light sleep
</pre>
</p><p>                                  

             With argument: puts CPU into light sleep for <i>NUM</i> seconds, minutes or hours. CPU wakes up by timer only, there are
             no other ways to cancel the sleep
</p>
<p>
Example: put CPU into light sleep for 10 minutes:
<pre>
	esp32#>nap 10 min
</pre>
Example: put CPU into light sleep for 100 seconds:
<pre>
	esp32#>nap 100
</pre>
	or
<pre>
	esp32#>nap 100 seconds
</pre>
NOTE: You can not set wake up time like that: "<b>10 hours 50 minutes</b>". Instead, use either "<b>11 hours</b>" or "<b>650 minutes</b>"
