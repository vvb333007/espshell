<p id="process"><h2>PROCESS CONTROL</h2></p>

<p>
Process control is implemented through three commands: <b>suspend</b>, <b>resume</b>, and <b>kill</b>. By "processes," 
we mean FreeRTOS tasks. For example, the main Arduino <i>loop()</i> runs as a dedicated FreeRTOS task named "loop" -
so "<i>loop()</i>" is a process.
</p>

<p>
Tasks are accessed and controlled using their TASK_ID (a hexadecimal number, e.g., "0x3fca370c"), 
except for the main Arduino loop() task: the main sketch execution can be controlled by omitting 
the TASK_ID parameter in the command. That is, to suspend the sketch, instead of writing 
"suspend 0x12345678", one can simply use "suspend" without arguments.
</p>

<p>
Okay, but where can we get these task IDs?
</p>

<p>
It's simple: every ESPShell command that is run as a background process displays its TASK_ID. 
Let's say we execute the command "pin 2 delay 1000" in the background:
<pre>
esp32#>pin 2 delay 1000 &
% Background task started
% Copy/paste "kill 0x3ffb91dc" to abort
esp32#>
</pre>
This command doesn't do much -just waits for 1000ms. Once started, it prints its task ID along with 
a convenient "kill" command that can be copied and executed: "kill 0x3ffb91dc".
</p>

<p>
Another source of TASK_IDs is the "<b><a href="Pulse_Counter.html#show">show counters</a></b>" command.

      <p>Pauses sketch execution by suspending Arduino's <b>loop()</b>. Tasks that were started by <b>loop()</b> 
      and <b>setup()</b> are <b>not suspended</b> by this command. Suspending a task along with all of its child tasks 
      is a planned but not yet implemented feature. Ctrl+C is a hotkey for the "<b>suspend</b>" command.</p>

<p>
To stop an ESPShell task (ESPShell <a href="Basics.html#background">uses tasks</a> to run background commands) or any 
arbitrary FreeRTOS task, use the <b>kill</b> command:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td><b>Command</b></td><td><b>Description and examples</b></td></tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>kill</b> <i>TASK_ID</i></td>
    <td>
<p><b>kill</b> [-TERM | -15 | -KILL | -9] <i>TASK_ID</i></p>

<p>
Stops execution of the task with the given TASK_ID. This ID is either printed when a background command 
is started or is the identifier of a generic FreeRTOS task. If the "&" symbol is used at the end of a command,
ESPShell executes it in the background by spawning a new task:
</p>

<pre>
      esp32#>pin 2 delay 999 &
      % Background task started
      % Copy/paste "kill 0x3fca370c" command to stop execution  &larr; note the TASK_ID
      esp32#>
</pre>

<p>
In the simplest case -when only the TASK_ID is provided -the command <i>sends a notification</i> to the task
in an attempt to initiate a graceful shutdown.
</p>

<p>
This command mimics the classic Linux <code>kill</code> command and accepts an optional signal parameter. 
<b>-9</b> or <b>-KILL</b> means forcibly terminate the task: no notification is sent; the task is 
suspended and then deleted via the FreeRTOS API <code>vTaskDelete()</code>. However, resources used by 
the task are not freed. Force-killing a task holding a mutex may result in system lockups.
</p>

<p>
All ESPShell-created tasks should normally be terminated this way -without using any additional parameters. 
However, there are examples of ESPShell commands that can only be terminated using <code>kill -9</code>. 
These special cases are described <a href="GPIO.html">in the documentation</a> for the "pin" command.
</p>

<p>
Using <b>-15</b>, <b>-TERM</b>, or no signal at all indicates a graceful shutdown: the task is not deleted 
but is given a chance to terminate itself and release any allocated resources.
</p>

<p>
Using <b>-9</b> or <b>-KILL</b> results in immediate task suspension and deletion via FreeRTOS 
<code>vTaskDelete()</code>. This is equivalent to the Linux <code>kill -9</code> command, but unlike its 
Linux counterpart, ESPShell does not release any memory or resources allocated by the task.
