<p><h2 id=fs><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>ESP32 FILESYSTEMS</h2></p>

<p>
As of 2024, there are three filesystems commonly used on ESP32 in IDF and 
Arduino projects: LittleFS, FAT, and SPIFFS (the latter is being deprecated soon). 
All three filesystems are supported by ESPShell in its tiny file manager.
</p><p>
There is a sample "partitions.csv" file that defines all three filesystems for 
testing purposes. This file, when placed in the sketch directory, will be used 
during the firmware upload process.
</p><p>
The following common storage media are supported:
</p><p>
<ul>
  <li>Internal flash memory: This is where your sketch gets uploaded.</li>
  <li>SD card on SPI interface.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
SDMMC with full 4-bit data lines is the fastest way to read/write SD cards. However, 
many devboards have only one data line connected (for example, the ESP32Cam). 
SDMMC in 1-bit mode is still faster than using an SD card on the SPI interface.
</p>

<p><h2 id=fs><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>ESPSHELL'S FILE MANAGER PURPOSE</h2></p>

</p><p>
The main purpose of ESPShell's file manager is to copy, move, rename, and delete 
files and directories that may be used by the sketch. Examples include configuration 
files, images from the camera, web server pages, logs, and so on.
</p><p>
ESPShell allows for copy and move operations across different filesystems. For example, 
a file can be copied or moved from FAT to LittleFS.
</p><p>
The shell supports SD memory cards over the SPI bus.
</p><p>
Additionally, ESPShell provides basic binary and text file editing capabilities. 
Users can create files, append strings or bytes to files, and insert or remove lines 
in text files.
</p>

<p><h2 id=fs><a href="#cmds">&#8686;</a>FILE MANAGER COMMANDS</h2></p>
</p><p>
To enter the file manager mode, type "<b>files</b>" and press &lt;Enter&gt;:
</p><p><pre>
  esp32#>files
  % Entering filesystem configuration mode. Ctrl+Z or "exit" to return
  % Main commands are still avaiable (but not visible in "?" command list)
  esp32#(/)>
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can see the current working directory displayed in the prompt, in 
brackets. This is called the root directory. The root directory is virtual 
and cannot be used like other directories. It is impossible to create files 
or directories in the root directory. It is used exclusively to hold mount 
points.
</p><p>
A mount point is a directory whose name starts with "/", 
for example, "/wwwroot", where the actual filesystem is deployed.
</p><p>
NOTE: If you want to include spaces (" ") in your path, use an asterisk "*" 
instead of spaces. ESPShell will convert the asterisks to spaces in paths and 
filenames. ESPShell does not support:        
</p><p><ul><li>
  File name completion, </li><li>
  Path wildcards</li></ul>
</p><p>
Now, let's take a look at the file manager commands (you can exit file manager
mode by pressing Ctrl+Z or typing "exit" and pressing &lt;Enter&gt;):
</p><p><pre>
  esp32#(/)>?
  % Enter "? command" to get details about specific command.
  % Enter "? keys" to display the espshell keyboard help page
  %
  % "?"          : Commands list & help
  % "mount"      : Mount partition/Show partition table

</p>
<p><h3 id=mount0><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>SHOW PARTITION TABLE & MOUNTED FILESYSTEMS: "mount"</h3></p>

---------------------------------------------------

The command without arguments displays the partition table and some information 
about mounted filesystems (the command "mount" was shortened to "m"):

  esp32#(/)>m
  %  Partition label |   Type    |   Size  |    Mounted on    |Total(Kb)|Free(Kb)
  % -----------------+-----------+---------+------------------+---------+--------
  %              nvs | NVStorage |    20Kb |                  |         |
  %          otadata |  OTA data |     8Kb |                  |         |
  %          wwwroot | FAT/exFAT |   960Kb |          /wwwroot|     920 |    920
  %             pr0n |    SPIFFS |   480Kb |                  |         |
  %             logs |  LittleFS |   480Kb |             /logs|     480 |    464
  %         coredump | Core dump |    64Kb |                  |         |
  %
  % 3 mountable partitions found
  esp32#(/)>

The output above shows that there are 3 different partitions, two of which 
are mounted under "/wwwroot" and "/logs". The "Size" column represents the 
raw filesystem size as it appears on the flash chip. The "Total" and "Free" 
columns display the total and available space within the filesystems.



<p><h3 id=mount><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>MOUNT PARTITION: "mount LABEL [/PATH]"</h3></p>

Same command but with 1 or 2 arguments: mount filesystems located on flash partition
LABEL under path /PATH. If /PATH (a mountpoint) is not specified then it is 
constructed from "/" and partition label (just as on screenshot above)

If filesystem being mounted fails to mount it is formatted an tried again.

LABEL can be shortened, but it does not affect mountpoint being generated: it will 
be full label name:

This command, when used with one or two arguments, mounts filesystems located on 
the flash partition with the specified LABEL under the specified /PATH. 
If /PATH (a mount point) is not provided, it is automatically generated by 
combining "/" with the partition label (as shown in the previous screenshot).

If the filesystem fails to mount, it will be formatted and the process will be retried.

The LABEL can be shortened, but this does not affect the generated mount point — it 
will still be the full label name:


  esp32#(/)>mount www
  %  FAT/exFAT  on partition "wwwroot" is mounted under "/wwwroot"
  esp32#(/)>

Here we used short label name ("www" instead of "wwwroot") but it was treated as if it 
was full name. The mountpoint was omitted and autogenerated from partition label name 
and "/"

Once mounted the filesystem is accessible under /PATH ("/wwwroot" in this case): user 
can "cd /wwwroot" and explore/modify the filesystem

In this example, we used the shortened label "www" instead of "wwwroot", but the 
system treated it as the full label name. The mount point was automatically 
generated based on the partition label and "/".

Once the filesystem is mounted, it can be accessed under /PATH (in this case, 
/wwwroot). The user can then use the cd command to navigate and explore/modify 
the filesystem:

Example: Mount the filesystem on the "wwwroot" partition under the mount point "/my/point":

  esp32#(/)>mount wwwroot /my/point
  %  FAT/exFAT  on partition "wwwroot" is mounted under "/my/point"
  esp32#(/)>


<p><h3 id=sd><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>MOUNTING AN SD CARD</h3></p>


"mount spi1|spi2|spi3|hspi|fspi|vspi MOSI MISO CLK CS [FREQ_KHZ] [/PATH]"

An SD card on an SPI bus can be mounted using the command above. The first argument specifies 
the SPI interface to use. The safest choice, which will work with all ESP32 models, is "hspi". 
Both the Arduino SPI interface naming convention and ESP-IDF (spi1, spi2, etc.) naming 
conventions are supported.

MOSI, MISO, CLK, and CS are the SPI bus pins (these are arbitrary GPIO pins where your SD 
card is connected).

FREQ_KHZ is an optional parameter specifying the SPI bus frequency. By default, SD cards 
are mounted and accessed at 20 MHz. However, when using longer connecting wires, such as 
on breadboards, it may be necessary to use a lower frequency (as low as 400 kHz) to avoid 
data transmission errors.



<p><h3 id=unmount><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>UNMOUNT PARTITION PREVIOUSLY MOUNTED WITH "MOUNT" : "unmount [PATH]"</h3></p>


Opposite of "mount" : unregister filesystems. Takes one optional argument: the mountpoint
path. If mountpoint is not specified then it is derived from the current working directory:

The unmount command is the opposite of mount — it unregisters filesystems. It takes one 
optional argument: the mountpoint path. If the mountpoint is not specified, it is derived 
from the current working directory:


  esp32#(/wwwroot/1/2/)>unmount
  % Unmounted  FAT/exFAT  partition "/wwwroot"
  esp32#(/)>

There is also command "umount" which is simply an alias for "unmount"



<p><h3 id=format><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>FORMAT FILESYSTEM : "format [LABEL]"</h3></p>

The format command is used to format the partition specified by the LABEL. If 
the LABEL is omitted, ESPShell derives the partition label from the current working directory:

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>format
  % Formatting partition "wwwroot", file system type is " FAT/exFAT "
  % done
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

The filesystem type is defined by the partitions.csv file and cannot be changed at runtime. 
For FAT filesystems, a quick format is performed (no data is erased, only the file allocation 
tables are cleared).


<p><h3 id=ls><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>DIRECTORY LISTING : "ls [PATH]"</h3></p>


The "ls" command displays a directory listing. If the PATH is omitted, the current working 
directory is used:

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>ls
  %    Size        Modified          *  Name
  %               -- level up --    DIR [..]
  %       171  1980-01-01 01:43:26  DIR [index]
  %       146  1980-01-01 01:43:26  DIR [logs]
  %         0  1980-01-01 01:43:26  DIR [uphp]
  %         0  1980-01-01 01:43:26  DIR [tmp]
  %        57  1980-01-01 01:46:18      index.html
  %
  % 4 directories, 1 file, 374 bytes
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

Displayed information: file/directory last modification time, file size in bytes, entry 
type (directories marked as DIR, files have no makrkings) and file/directory name.


Displayed information includes:
  Size: File or directory size in bytes
  Modified: Last modification time
  Type: Directories are marked as DIR, and files have no marking
  Name: File or directory name, with directory names displayed in square brackets. 
        The special .. directory (to go up one level) is also shown.

The entries are ordered by creation time, with no sorting applied.

Example: Display the content of the /wwwroot/index/ directory:

  esp32#(/)>ls wwwroot/index
  %    Size        Modified          *  Name
  %               -- level up --    DIR [..]
  %        57  1980-01-01 01:45:00      index.php
  %        57  1980-01-01 01:45:16      index_old.php
  %        57  1980-01-01 01:45:26      index_html
  %
  % 0 directories, 3 files, 171 bytes
  esp32#(/)>

The PATH argument must be a directory path, with or without a trailing /.

Important: By default, the ls command displays the total size of directories, calculated recursively. 
This may take time and consume memory. If this is an issue, you can change the behavior by running 
the command var ls_show_dir_size 0, which will disable directory size reporting in the ls command.



<p><h3 id=cd><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>CHANGE DIRECTORY : "cd [PATH|..]"</h3></p>

There are three variations of the "cd" command:

  1. "cd"
  Without parameters, changes the current working directory (CWD) to the root of the 
  currently mounted filesystem (not to be confused with the root directory /, which is 
  the global root for all filesystems):

        esp32#(/wwwroot/1/2/)>cd
        esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

  2. "cd .."
  Changes the current directory to its parent. Only one level is changed per command — 
  compound paths like ../../ are not supported.  If the parent directory does not exist 
  (as is often the case with complex mountpoints like /my/mount/point/ where intermediate 
  directories /my and /mount do not physically exist), then cd .. continues upward until 
  a valid directory is reached.

       esp32#(/)>mount wwwroot /a/mount/point
       %  FAT/exFAT  on partition "wwwroot" is mounted under "/a/mount/point"
       esp32#(/)>cd /a/mount/point
       esp32#(/a/mount/point/)>cd ..
       esp32#(/)>

  In this case, cd .. brings us back to /, not to /a/mount, because /a/mount/point is 
  treated as a single virtual mount path rather than a nested directory structure.

  3. "cd PATH"
  Changes the current working directory to PATH, similar to Linux or Windows shells.
  Absolute paths must start with a mountpoint

  Relative paths are interpreted relative to the current directory

       esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cd test_dir/dir2       # change dir (relative path)
       esp32#(/wwwroot/test_dir/dir2/)>cd       # back to filesystem root
       esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cd ..                  # and 1 more level up 
       esp32#(/)>



<p><h3 id=rm><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>DELETE FILES/DIRECTORIES : "rm PATH"</h3></p>

Deletes the file or directory specified by PATH.

  1. If PATH is a file, it will be deleted.
  2. If PATH is a directory, the directory and all of its contents will be deleted recursively, with no confirmation.


  esp32#(/)>ls wwwroot/test_dir
  % Size/Used      Modified          *  Name
  %               -- level up --    DIR [..]
  %            1980-01-01 01:00:24  DIR [dir2]
  %         4  1980-01-01 01:16:20      test.cfg
  %
  % 1 directory, 1 file, 4 bytes


  esp32#(/)>rm wwwroot/test_dir
  % Directory removed: "/wwwroot/test_dir/dir2/"
  % File removed: "/wwwroot/test_dir/test.cfg"
  % Directory removed: "/wwwroot/test_dir/"
  % 3 files/directories were deleted
  esp32#(/)>

  Directories in the root "/" (virtual root of all mountpoints) cannot be deleted with "rm": for example "rm /wwwroot" will fail.
  To remove those, use the unmount command instead.


<p><h3 id=write><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>WRITE BYTES : "write PATH [TEXT]"</h3></p>

Writes an arbitrary string of bytes or characters to a file. If the file does not exist, it is created.
If the file exists, its entire content is overwritten each time "write" is used.

To append or modify files without overwriting, use the commands "append", "insert", or "delete".

The TEXT argument (data to be written) can include:

  regular characters and spaces,
  escape sequences:
    \\  = backslash
    \n  = newline
    \r  = carriage return
    \t  = tab
    \AB = byte with hexadecimal value AB

If TEXT is omitted, a single newline (\n) is written.

  Example 1: 

Create a new file test.cfg (or overwrite an existing one) with the "Hello World!", 
and the next line consisting of bytes 61 62 63 64 65 \n:

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>write test.cfg Hello World\n\61\62\63\64\65\n
  % 18 bytes written
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

If PATH includes subdirectories that don’t yet exist, they will be automatically created.



<p><h3 id=append><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>APPEND BYTES : "append PATH TEXT"</h3></p>

Appends data to the end of an existing file — works similarly to the write command, 
but does not erase existing content.

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>append test.cfg \nNew line
  % 9 bytes written
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

  Use "write" to overwrite a file, or "insert" / "delete" to modify specific lines.



<p><h3 id=insert><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>INSERT BYTES INTO TEXT FILE : "insert PATH LINE_NUM [TEXT]"</h3></p>

Inserts TEXT (which may include multiple lines separated by \n) before the line number LINE_NUM 
in the file at PATH.
Note: A final \n is automatically added to each inserted line — there's no need to manually include 
\n at the end of every string unless you're inserting multiple lines.


  Display a file, insert a multiline string into the file:

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat -n index.html
     1: <html>
     2: <head></head>
     3: <body>
     4: Hello World!
     5: </body>
     6: </html>
     7:
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>insert index.html 4 Hey! This line was inserted!\nAnd this line also!
  %% Line inserted
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat -n index.html
     1: <html>
     2: <head></head>
     3: <body>
     4: Hey! This line was inserted!
     5: And this line also!
     6: Hello World!
     7: </body>
     8: </html>
     9:
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

As with the write command, escape sequences like \n, \r, \t, and \XX (hex byte) are supported.
If TEXT is omitted entirely, a single newline (empty line) is inserted.


<p><h3 id=delete><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>DELETE LINES IN TEXT FILE : "delete PATH LINE_NUM [COUNT]"</h3></p>

Deletes COUNT lines starting from line number LINE_NUM in the file PATH.
If COUNT is omitted, it defaults to 1:



  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat -n index.html
   1: <html>
   2: <head></head>
   3: <body>
   4: Hey! This line was inserted!
   5: And this line also!
   6: Hello World!
   7: </body>
   8: </html>
   9:
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>delete index.html 4 2
  % 2 lines deleted starting at line 4
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat -n index.html
   1: <html>
   2: <head></head>
   3: <body>
   4: Hello World!
   5: </body>
   6: </html>
   7:


<p><h3 id=mkdir><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>CREATE DIRECTORY/IES : "mkdir PATH1 PATH2 ... PATHn"</h3></p>

Creates one or more directories. Nested path creation is supported — for 
example, "mkdir 1/2/3/4" will create all missing intermediate directories as needed.

Example 1: Create multiple directories under /wwwroot

  esp32#(/)>cd wwwroot
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>mkdir 1 2 3
  % Directory created: "/wwwroot/1/"
  % Directory created: "/wwwroot/2/"
  % Directory created: "/wwwroot/3/"
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>


This command cannot create directories directly in the root / directory — use 
the "mount" command to create or define new entries under /.

NOTE on paths with spaces:
  If you need spaces in directory or file names, use an asterisk (*) instead of a space.
  ESPShell will automatically convert asterisks to spaces during path processing. 

  Example:

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>mkdir My*Documents
  % Directory created: "/wwwroot/My Documents/"

 Limitation: When creating nested directories with asterisks in the path (e.g., mkdir My*Folder/Sub*Dir), the conversion may not work as expected. This is a known issue.


<p><h3 id=touch><a href="#top">&#8686;</a>CREATE NEW OR UPDATE TIMESTAMPS ON EXISTING FILE(S) : "touch PATH1 PATH2 ... PATHn"</h3></p>

This command works similarly to its Linux counterpart:

  It creates new empty files if they don't exist.
  It updates modification timestamps on existing files.
  If the specified PATH includes subdirectories, ESPShell will automatically create all required directories leading up to the file.

  Example 1: Create multiple new files in the current directory

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
  % File created: "/wwwroot/file1.txt"
  % File created: "/wwwroot/file2.txt"
  % File created: "/wwwroot/file3.txt"
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>


  Example 2: Update timestamp of an existing file

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>touch file1.txt
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>


  Example 3: Create a file in a nested directory (with auto-creation of missing folders)

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>touch dir1/dir2/config.json
  % Directory created: "/wwwroot/dir1/"
  % Directory created: "/wwwroot/dir1/dir2/"
  % File created: "/wwwroot/dir1/dir2/config.json"
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

This command displays the content of a file (text or binary) or transmits it over a UART port.
Unlike its Linux counterpart, ESPShell's cat command does not support multiple files (so it can not be used to join files).


BASIC USAGE

To display a file as plain text:

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat index.html
  <html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
  Hey! This line was inserted!
  And this line also!
  Hello World!
  </body>
  </html>
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>


DISPLAY SPECIFIC LINES
You can use the LINE_NUM and COUNT arguments to display only part of the file:

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat index.html 4 2
  Hey! This line was inserted!
  And this line also!
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

SHOW LINE NUMBERS
Use -n to prefix each line with its line number. Useful when using insert or delete:

   esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat -n index.html
   1: <html>
   2: <head></head>
   3: <body>
   4: Hey! This line was inserted!
   5: And this line also!
   6: Hello World!
   7: </body>
   8: </html>
   esp32#(/wwwroot/)>


DISPLAY FILE AS BINARY (HEX + ASCII)
Use -b to interpret file contents as binary and display a hex dump:


  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat -b index.html

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>



TRANSMIT FILE OVER UART

The cat command can also be used to send file content over an initialized UART interface. 
When the -b option is used, the file’s raw content (binary data) is transmitted over UART, 
without formatting or line numbers.

This is especially useful for transferring files to devices connected via UART. For example, 
the SIM7600 LTE module, which has a 64GB internal storage, can be used to send large files 
over LTE. The transfer is handled by the module itself, reducing CPU load on the host device.

  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>cat -b firmware.bin uart 2
  % Binary file sent over UART2 (14832 bytes)
  esp32#(/wwwroot/)>

"show mount [/PATH]" 

The "show mount" command displays information about mounted filesystems.
Without arguments, it shows a list of available partitions and mountpoints for partitions that are already mounted:

    esp32#>sh mount
    % Disk partition |M|File system| Size on |    Mounted on    |Capacity |  Free
    %    label       |?|   type    |  flash  |                  |  total  |  space

    %            logs|+|  LittleFS |    480K |                  |         |
    %        coredump| | Core dump |     64K |                  |         |
    %
    % 3 mountable partitions found. (+) - mountable partition
    esp32#>

This keyword is an alias to "mount" filesystem command.

Used with 1 argument (a directory path) displays information on a given mountpoint:

    esp32#>sh mount /w
    % Mount point "/wwwroot",  FAT/exFAT , (partition label is "wwwroot")
    % Wear-levelling layer is active on this media
    % Filesystem is located on internal SPI FLASH
