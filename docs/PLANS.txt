++1. Support for SD memory cards on SPI interfaces.

2. Make file manager be able to send/receive files over ftp protocol (simpliest ftp server). 
   FTP can handle bulk file operations (mass file transfer, directory structure creation)
   and often is supported by various file managers as an external filesystem. This will greatly
   simplify file transfers between ESP32 and host PC

3. Implement "mv" and "cp" commands which
  a. Work when SRC and DST are on two deifferent filesystems
  b. Both commands are able to replicate SRC directory structure by default

4. Hardware crypto: add a general use crypto tool (encrypt/decrypt/hash arbitrary data)

5. Create a solution for the scenario where ESP32Cam: 
  a. makes a picture, 
  b. saves it to SIMCOM7600E internal filesystem (via uart/AT commands), and 
  c. sends by internet to remote host
