Known problems not solved yet
-----------------------------
1. console_read_bytes() and console_write_bytes() for USBCDC boards 
   (like Nano ESP32, or generic ESP32-S3 devboards with USB-OTG enabled)


2. Filename completion. Even thinking of it is frustrating. BTW when 
   <TAB> is pressed - tab_pressed() is called so one wishing to help 
   can start from there

++3. PWM mystery (see pwm_enable() code) (solved?)
