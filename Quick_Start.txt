FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO READ DOCUMENTATION:
-----------------------------------------------

 Follow these steps:
 
 a. Copy espshell.c to your sketch directory (where your .ino file is).
 
 b. Compile & upload your sketch as usual. (espshell will gain control 
    automatically on startup)
    
 c. Yes! Now you can access the command line interface via Arduino 
    IDE's Serial Monitor or ( better ) thru terminal software: Linux cu, 
    Windows TeraTerm or PuTTY.

    Start with typing "?" and pressing <Enter>
    Enjoy!
